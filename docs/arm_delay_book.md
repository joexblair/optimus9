# Arm-delay spec 0709 — the book, and what is and isn't real (0710)

Tools: `arm_walk.py` (the walk) · `arm_case.py` (one hunt) · `arm_batch.py` (a window) · `arm_seq.py`
(deduped arms + MAE/MFE) · `arm_trade.py` (the full flow) · `arm_days.py` (N days) · `arm_sweep.py`
(one knob, worst-day scored) · `arm_filters.py` (post-hoc filters).

All reads go through `optimus9.analysis.jig`. Prediction is `predict_breach` with an explicit `tol`
(default `0.0` = the spec). Nothing hand-rolled.

## The flow as built

```
HUNT      an s5m IB->OOB crossing at a 300s seam.  s5m = bb 8|0.65|ohlc4, emerging
          (Joe named the value 0710; it is the ONE hardcoded config, pending a sweep into indicator_configs).
apex      starts at TF5.  Climbs only AT the apex's r coarse curl, when the TF above has predicted or breached.
curl seam TF/div, banded: tf<=7 -> TF/2 · 8..14 -> TF/4 · >14 -> TF/6
ARM       LATCH, no expiry: the apex's r and the TF above are both OOB and both have curled.
          (`htf-quiet` is a no-op — keep walking.)
GATE      lr_v2.gate_open (reasons a / b / c) from the arm bar.
FINISHER  lr_v2.s_qualify (s15a, s30a) -> fin_gate.  The trade bar.
TP        scan up from the arm TF until an r is not OOB; the last OOB TF is the TP TF.
          Follow that TF's mini to the far side; exit on its first reversal while OOB there.
```

## The 9-day book

`[measured]` 2026-07-01 .. 2026-07-09, 292 arms, cost 0.20% round-trip.

```
producer=arm     (no gate, no finisher)   -0.1180%/trade  win 54.5%  gross +0.0820%  days+ 4/9
producer=gate    (gate + finishers)       -0.0296%/trade  win 63.0%  gross +0.1704%  days+ 5/9
```

The gate + finishers add **+0.088%/trade and +8.5 points of win rate**, and they help on all nine days.
Both books still lose to cost: gross `+0.17%` against `0.20%`.

Per day (gate):
```
07-01  -0.3161%   07-02  -0.2021%   07-03  -0.0421%   07-04  +0.0648%   07-05  +0.0167%
07-06  +0.0357%   07-07  +0.0367%   07-08  +0.2099%   07-09  -0.1043%
```

Apex distribution, 292 arms: `TF5 x108 · TF6 x117 · TF7 x47 · TF8 x9 · TF9 x7 · TF10 x2 · TF11 x1 · TF12 x1`.

## REFUTED — do not re-propose

- **The `MFE@10m` bail.** Every `(N, X)` cell is worse than doing nothing. `N=10m X=0.20%` takes the book
  from `-0.0296%` to `-0.0630%` and days-positive from `5/9` to `2/9`. It was derived from the
  negative-gross rows — a set selected on outcome. It cuts the slow winners.
- **"`tpTF == apex` warns of a dead move."** Backwards. Trades where the ladder above the arm *was*
  awake do WORSE: `tpTF > apex`, n=50, `-0.0918%/trade`, worst day `-1.4121%`.
- **`cap` as a lever.** `cap=30` scored `+0.506%/trade at 100% win` — entirely a survivorship bug in
  `arm_trade.py`: a trade whose exit never fired inside `cap` was *dropped from the book*. With the
  guard (mark to market at `cap`), `cap=30` is `-0.0192%` at 53.6% win. `cap` does nothing.

## The one filter that survives

```
apex TF >= 6   n=184  -0.0221%  win 65.8%  days+ 6/9
apex TF >= 7   n=67   +0.0499%  win 70.1%  days+ 6/9   worst day -0.4687%   gross +0.25%
apex TF >= 8   n=20   -0.0364%  win 65.0%  days+ 4/8
```

The only positive cell in the filter table. It is not "higher is better" — TF8+ turns negative again.
67 trades over 9 days. **Untested out of sample.**

## OUT OF SAMPLE — 20 days, 669 trades (2026-06-20 .. 2026-07-09)

`[measured]` `producer=gate`, cost 0.20%.

```
baseline                    -0.0846%/trade   win 61.0%   gross +0.1154%   days+  6/20
```

Every filter that looked good on 9 days changes sign on 20:

```
                              9 days (n=292)          20 days (n=669)
apex TF >= 7                +0.0499%  days+ 6/9     -0.0581%  days+ 10/20
apex TF >= 8                -0.0364%  days+ 4/8     +0.0279%  days+ 11/17
tpTF > apex                 -0.0918%  worst -1.41   +0.1113%  days+ 13/20
```

Nine days was a lucky slice. **No filter in this work is real.**

### The edge is real. It is smaller than the cost.

Day-block bootstrap (resampling DAYS, not trades — trades inside a day are not independent):

```
gross mean          +0.1154%     sd 0.9683%     SE 0.0374%
95% CI on gross     [+0.0409%, +0.1799%]
P(gross > 0)                          99.8%
P(gross > 0.20%, i.e. beats cost)      0.4%
gross > 0 on 70.3% of trades
per-day gross:  p50 +0.1281%   min -0.4067%   max +0.4099%   days above cost: 6/20
```

### Nothing closes the gap from the strategy side

- **Knobs are flat.** Every knob, 9 days, `producer=gate`, scored on gross mean:
  `m_mult` 0.44→0.62 spans `+0.152%..+0.170%` · `bands` best `+0.1738%` (baseline `+0.1704%`) ·
  `tol` 0/2/4/6 = `+0.1704 / +0.1770 / +0.1678 / +0.1661%` · `m_len` 6/7/8 = `+0.1677 / +0.1704 / +0.1520%` ·
  `cap` does nothing once the survivorship guard is in.
  **The whole grid spans `+0.145%..+0.177%` gross. The cost is `0.20%`.**
  Two spec values are contradicted, both inside the noise: `tol = 4.0` is worse than `tol = 0`
  (`+0.1678%` vs `+0.1704%`, days-positive `3/9` vs `5/9`), and `tol = 2` is nominally best. `m_len = 7`
  (the spec's middle) is the best of the three.
- **Every hard stop loses.** `none +0.1154%` · `0.8% stop +0.0915%` · `0.3% stop +0.0683%`. The worst 5%
  of trades drag the mean by `-0.1487%`, but stopping them costs more than they take. Same verdict
  `project_exit_curl` reached on a different book.
- **`lr_exit_v2` does not beat the far-side-mini TP.** Same mean, 15 points worse win rate, worse worst
  day, holds twice as long.

### The gap is COST, and it is not a strategy problem

`[read]` `ledger.py:58` — `taker_bps = 5.5` is the fee per side, not slippage. Slippage is a separate
`3.35 bps/side`, measured live (`project_o9live_desync_fix`). A resting maker order pays none.

```
fill            fees     slip     cost    net mean   net @CI lo   net @CI hi
taker/taker    0.110%   0.067%   0.177%   -0.0616%    -0.1361%     +0.0029%
taker/maker    0.075%   0.034%   0.108%   +0.0069%    -0.0676%     +0.0714%
maker/maker    0.040%   0.000%   0.040%   +0.0754%    +0.0009%     +0.1399%
harness EST                      0.200%   -0.0846%
```

**Break-even round-trip cost = 0.1154%.** Taker-in/taker-out cannot get there. Maker-in/maker-out clears
it with the whole confidence interval above zero. Post-only entry is the single largest untested lever
in this work, and it changes no signal.

## Open

- **Post-only / maker fills.** The largest lever, and it touches no signal. Needs a fill-probability
  model: a resting bid that never fills is a missed trade, not a free one.
- **The stale hunt.** With no cancel, the 18:45 hunt armed at 21:00 on a TF6/TF7 pair that had nothing
  to do with it. `s5m` in-bounds for N consecutive seams is the natural bound, and it is one knob.
- **The emerging bar-open sawtooth** (`docs/emerging_bar_open.md`). One in five OOB crossings lands on
  the higher-TF bar open, and those crossings persist better than any other. The rolling-window variant
  (option 3 there) would remove the sawtooth entirely and changes every line on the board — Joe's call.
- `s{tf}m` still needs its own sweep and a write into `indicator_configs`; `S5M_OVERRIDE` in
  `arm_walk.py` is the only hardcoded config in this work.
