# Exit v2 + bias filter — design & real-world grounding (0701)

Everything here is anchored to one real trade so ideas are easy to share: **06-17 18:46 SHORT** (FARTCOINUSDT).
Data window = the real-tick span 06-17 → 06-22 (n=266 v2 entries). See also `lr_cascade_design.md` (cascade
internals), `bias_mechanics_design.md` (bro-cross), `epoch_anchor_spec.md`.

## The running trade — 06-17 18:46 SHORT (threads through every section)
| moment | time | what |
|---|---|---|
| entry | 18:46:00 | short opens |
| favourable extreme reached | **19:05:35** | s5m breaches LO (the "given" — price is now genuinely favourable) |
| cascade gate opens | 19:37:05 | s7r finally predict-then-breaches — **32 min late** (the flaky prediction) |
| the curl | 19:37:10 | s5r flips up (reversal toward es) |

Exits it produced, three ways:
- **og_book** (corrected): **+1.70%** @ 19:05:35 · **cascade predict=False**: +2.1% @ 19:22 · **cascade predict=True**: +2.7% @ 19:37.

---

## 1. og_book — the entry-quality ruler (the corrected reference)
- **What:** `lr_exit(curl_fam=s7, exit_on=s30a_s15a, predict_gate=True, arm_gate=True)`. The old small-profit exit,
  gated so the finisher can't fire before the favourable **s5m breach** has happened.
- **Why the fix:** raw `lr_exit` fired the finisher whenever it liked — **69% of its exits had no s5m breach yet**
  (s5m only *blocked* the trigger, never *gated* it). `arm_gate=True` requires the breach first.
- **Numbers:** net **+66.5%**, win **66%**, avg **+0.250%** (n=266). [old un-gated: +59.8% / 75% — the 75% was
  early-profit-taking, not extra wins.] 18:46: +0.86% → **+1.70%**.
- **Role:** the STABLE, exit-agnostic ruler the bias dials against. **Not** the shipping exit — the cascade is.
- **Key fact (validated):** for the 137 wins that exited before their s5m breach, **137/137 breach favourable later**
  — the opposite-side s5m breach is a *given*; gating on it strengthens wins, never removes them. (It can lower
  *win%* — 75→66 — because the SL can hit *before* the breach on some; survivors are bigger, so net rises.)

## 2. Exit cascade (lr_exit_v2) — the entry machine pointed at the −es extreme
One machine, two polarities: entry fires on `es`, exit fires on `−es` (= `bd`). Shared `_finish` core (SRP).
```
exit-arm  s5m breach on bd            →   19:05:35
gate      {gate_fam}r predict-then-breach on bd (slip knob; predict on/off)   →   19:37:05
unlatch   s5r reversal toward es (the curl — s5r : s7r :: s2M : s3/s4)         →   19:37:10
finisher  _finish: latch s30a+s15a from the arm, delatch at the unlatch  →  exit = max(latched, unlatch)
```
- **Gate-line AB** (over 266): slower `s7r` = bigger rides + more culls (48%); faster `s6r`/`s5r` = fewer culls,
  lower net; **`s7r+slip20` = fewest culls (28%) at +50.8% net** (slip recovers near-OOB curls).
- **The flaky prediction (18:46 in the act):** `predict=True`'s s7r prediction lagged the breach by **32 min**
  (19:05→19:37), so the exit landed at a "seemingly random" point — wherever the prediction tripped. `predict=False`
  fires on the s7r breach itself (19:22). **The s7m/s7M multi sweep (84,700 combos already built) tunes this.**

## 3. Strand rescue — the 67 refugees  ⭐ NEW
- **Problem:** when **s7r never breaches**, the gate never opens and the trade rides to SL. This hits **67 trades
  = 25% of the book, 47% of all SLs** (predict=False: 142 SLs, 67 stranded).
- **Regime (Joe 0701):** this is the **sideways-market exit** — s7r can't breach without a momentum leg, so in a
  range trades strand precisely here. The s7r-breach cascade owns *trending*; the strand rescue owns *ranging*. A
  clean regime-split, and why it's "an important addition to the suite."
- **Premise (validated):** ALL 67 had a favourable **s5r + s5M** curl *before* the SL — the price handed us a
  window, the s7r gate just wouldn't let us take it. None were lost causes.
- **Mechanism (Joe 0701) — three jobs, cleanly split:**
  - **① s7r-momentum GATE (the "tractor beam"):** while s7r is being pulled toward the breach, HOLD. **Poll each
    `s15m` wob (2-bar wob)** — s15a is too sparse — and collect the s7r value. When s7r **recedes** (moves *away*
    from the breach it was approaching, back toward 50) across polls → **release** the gate; else wait for the next
    wob.
  - **② s5r + s5M reversal TRIGGER:** the reversal fires the finisher — but ONLY once the beam is released. While
    the beam holds, a reversal creates *no action* (fast lines wiggle; the beam is what turns "any wiggle" into
    "the real curl").
  - **③ favourable-side GUARD (the gotcha):** the finisher may only fire while **s5m is on the favourable side**.
    If the next finisher signal lands while s5m has swung to the ADVERSE OOB (the worst exit), **keep the gate
    closed, let s5m run back to the favourable side, and re-test.** Loop until a favourable-side finisher fires
    **or the SL closes it** — the re-test is free downside (a strand trade would SL anyway; it only adds upside).
    **UNIVERSAL RULE (Joe confirmed): no finisher exit fires while s5m is adverse-OOB — on EVERY exit path.** Data
    check: the *normal* cascade already has **0 adverse-OOB exits** (it exits promptly, before s5m can swing), so
    the guard is a **safety rail + future-proof, not a hidden lever** — it only bites where the wait is long (the
    strand rescue). [Minor: ~15 normal exits fire with s5m *IB* — mid, not adverse — the guard passes them; tighten
    to favourable-OOB-only later if they read meh.]
  - **SRP:** momentum *decides* (gate) · reversal *fires* (trigger) · s5m-side *guards* (no adverse exits).
  - **Redundancy (the happy-accident payoff):** the three layers are three *different-TF* confirmations that must
    AGREE before an exit fires — s7r (slow) exhaustion · s5r/s5M (fast) turn · s5m (fast) side. No single signal
    can force an exit; a **stale slow-finisher gets vetoed by the fast s5m** (exactly the 23:24 catch). It's the
    LTF-completes-HTF basis of the whole strategy, now applied to the exit.
  - **Gate-as-data:** multiple openers (s7r-breach · s5r+s5M-when-s7r-recedes-and-s5m-favourable) → gate-table rows.
- **06-18 worked example (LONG exit; tape-verified against TV closed):**
  | time | poll s7r | s5m | note |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 22:52:15 | 68.5 | hi-oob | poll; s7r climbing toward the breach |
  | 23:00:00 | 84.1 | hi-oob | s5m+s5M reverse — **no action** (s7r 84.1, deep in the beam near 85) |
  | 23:02:45 | 84.1 | hi-oob | beam holds |
  | 23:08:45 | **72.1** | IB | s7r **receded 84→72 → release the gate** |
  | 23:24:00 | 47.1 | **lo-oob** | finisher hi-signal fires but s5m is adverse → **hold, wait for s5m to return, re-test** |
- **BUILT & clarified (`strand_rescue`, Joe 0701):** the spec's mechanism was over-built — the s7r tractor-beam is
  a *rare* branch, not the spine. **s7r is *invisible* (mid, inside the 20/80 fence) for 65 of 67 strands** — they
  never approach the breach (that's *why* they strand), so the finishers simply take the **s5r curl at the
  favourable extreme**. The tractor-beam **hold-while-visible-until-the-next-s5m-breach** fires on only **2/67**.
  **Full stack — cascade + strand_rescue (predict=False):** SL **142→75** · net **+47.8→+108.5%** · win **45→70%**
  · net-of-cost **−0.020 → +0.208** — the sideways rescue **more than doubles net and flips net-of-cost solidly
  positive**, before the bias filter. Sanity-checked: forward-walk, real entry→extreme moves (median 1-min
  arm→exit), *not* a degenerate peak-exit. One 5-day window; OOS owed.
- *Superseded ceiling (kept for context):* the loose "+60.7%" earlier was the earliest-wiggle upper bound; the
  built number lands at the same magnitude but for the right reason (the curl at the extreme, s7r invisible).

## 4. Bias entry-filter — the hb33 lever (sweep complete)
- **What:** the hb33 bro-cross bias (3 sets `hbhl33`/`hblo33`/`hbhi33`; first OOB Mage×min cross flips the state,
  clustered) → **reject against-grain entries** (`bias == −bd`) at entry, before the exit ever runs.
- **Sweep:** 84,700 combos = TF(9–36) × mage-len(19±5) × min-len(13±5) × hbhl33 mage-src(5) × min-src(5), scored
  as filtered **avg_ret + win** on og_book (`bias_grav_sweep.py`, ~31 min; reuses `bro_stream`/`bro_verdict`).
- **Result:** best config (tf26 / lenM24 / lenm9) **avg +0.389% / win 77% / kept 137** vs baseline +0.250 / 66% →
  **~2× total net-of-cost** (+26% vs +13%), ~4× per-trade.
- **Robustness:** **83,311 / 84,699 configs (98%) beat baseline** — rejecting a *random* half wouldn't, so the
  with-grain signal is genuinely informative (counter-trend entries are broadly worse). Top avg is a **16-way tie**
  → take *a* robust config, don't over-fit *the* config.
- **Caveat:** one 5-day window; out-of-sample validation owed. Vindicates the OG-book choice — it exposed a signal
  the cull-labels (50/50) hid.

## Two validated levers, and the open decisions
- **Lever A — bias entry-filter:** ~2× net-of-cost (sweep confirmed, robust).
- **Lever B — s7r-strand rescue:** 67 refugees, all with catchable curls (ceiling +60.7%, real TBD).
- **Relationship (MEASURED 0701):** of the 67 refugees — **32 are also bias-rejected** (bias handles them at
  entry), **35 are bias-KEPT** (unique to the strand rescue), and the bias rejects 129/266 overall. **~50/50 →
  largely COMPLEMENTARY at the *entry* level. **BUT stacked at the P&L level they are NOT additive** (capstone
  0701): ALL 266 + cascade + strand = net-of-cost **+0.208/trade, total +55.3%**; adding the bias filter →
  **+0.361/trade & 77% win but total drops to +49.5%** — the strand rescue rescues trades the filter would
  reject, so once rescued into profit, filtering them *removes* profit. **Strand rescue = primary lever (flips
  net-of-cost positive alone); bias filter = a quality-vs-volume dial** (fewer/cleaner/higher-win at less total).
  Which wins is a strategic call — raw profit favours no-filter, capital-efficiency favours filter.
- **OOS VALIDATED (0701, full 10.3-day / 555-trade window):** strand rescue holds — net-of-cost **+0.196 across all
  555** (~identical to the 5-day +0.208; it's a mechanism, so 555 trades are essentially all-OOS). Bias filter (config
  fit on the back-5-days) **generalises to the front-6-days OOS**: +0.215 vs +0.184/trade, win 73 vs 68 — real +
  positive but the lift **shrinks** vs in-sample (+0.031 vs +0.086), the expected residual overfit. **Both levers
  de-risked.** Strand rescue = robust primary; bias filter = a genuine-but-modest quality dial.

**Open, to nail before/while building:**
1. Strand rescue: the s7r fence (20/80?), the exact "receding" test (Δ toward 50 over one s15a cycle?), the
   gate-as-data schema.
2. Build order: strand rescue vs bias filter first (or measure their overlap first).
3. Out-of-sample validation for both levers (2nd real-tick window).

## Sizing & equity map (0701) — `build_v2_walk.py`
- **Dynamic sizing (the survival mechanism):** notional = **5× account** (Joe: safety-first), lots =
  `min(66,000 coins, 5×account/price)`, **compounding** — a loss shrinks the *next* lot, so it can't blow up.
  Fixed 66k *liquidated* (max DD 636 > 500 account); proportional never does (it ramps to the 66k cap as the
  account grows, then holds). Note: FARTCOIN ≈ $0.11–0.15, so 66k coins ≈ $7.5–9.9k notional.
- **5× projection** ($500 start · 0.20% est cost · full 555-trade / 10.3-day window): **$500 → $8,770 (17.5×)**,
  max DD **34%**, hits the 66k cap at trade 219, min equity $347 (survives).
- **Leverage tradeoff:** 2x $3.9k/15%DD · 3x $6.6k/22% · **5x $8.8k/34% (chosen)** · 8x $9.5k/50% — diminishing
  above 5×.
- **CAVEATS (not a promise):** a *backtest* ceiling on the training window, at the **estimated 0.20% cost** and
  15–20× effective leverage. The DB `ticks` table is empty (68 rows); **real fills + true Bybit order-book
  slippage come from o9-live** — that's the validation, this is the target to beat. `v2_walk` carries per-trade
  entry_px / lot / notional / pnl_usdt / equity.

## Extreme sweep (0702) — the arm was mis-tuned
5500-config covering-block sweep (see [[project_sweep_harness]]), worst-window minimax over 7 windows
(05-18→06-24). **One robust lever surfaced: `s5m_len` 10 → 6** (the arm BB — its cross into OOB fires entry).
- **Unanimous:** all top-40 configs use s5m_len=6; next-most-tweaked knob only 7/40. Strategy knobs otherwise
  converge to ship (curl=s7 · gate=s7 · exit_rlb=22 · slip=0 · **bias=OFF** — the sweep independently re-confirms
  the bias filter doesn't lift net).
- **Isolated** (s5m_len=6 only, else ship): worst-window **+33.0 → +68.7**, trades 554→685, win 68→77%.
- **OOS-validated** on fresh post-06-24 data (06-27/29, 07-01): beats ship **3/3**, +48–62 pts net, +5–6% win.
  Not regime-fit. Mechanism: len=10 arm too slow — a tighter band catches setups earlier → more trades AND
  higher win. The winner's extra +20pts (SL/pred/scattered lines) never isolate/repeat → **overfit tail, discarded.**
- **Shipped:** `indicator_configs` s5m new version (ic_pk=115, `ic_live_after_dt` 2026-07-02, `ic_bb_len` 6);
  old len=10 (ic_pk=88) retained for audit. Live path verified (`evaluate({})` reads len=6).
- **New equity** (`build_v2_walk.py`, same $500 / 0.20% / 5×): **$500 → $15,026 (30.1×)**, 682 trades, 77% win,
  **max DD 21.8%** (early, trade 38 @ ~$600 → $469 min; survives). Better than the old arm on BOTH axes
  ($8,770→$15,026 return, 34%→21.8% DD). Same caveats: one window, in-sample-compounded, estimated cost —
  o9-live is the referee.
